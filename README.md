# Cloud-Enabled IIoT Smart Grid Demand-Side Management Platform

## 🌍 SDG Alignment
This project supports:
- SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy
- SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure
- SDG 13 – Climate Action

## 📌 Project Overview
Peak electricity demand leads to grid instability, high operational costs, and increased carbon emissions. Traditional power grids lack real-time consumer-side demand management.

This project proposes a Cloud-Based Industrial IoT (IIoT) Smart Grid Demand-Side Management Platform that dynamically adjusts non-essential loads based on time-of-use pricing.

The system simulates smart meter data, applies dynamic pricing signals, and automatically manages devices such as EV chargers and air conditioners during peak hours.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The platform consists of four layers:

1. Device Layer  
   - Simulated Smart Meter  
   - Smart Home / Commercial Devices  

2. Communication Layer  
   - HTTP-based data transmission (simulated)  

3. Cloud Layer  
   - Streamlit Cloud Deployment  
   - Centralized Data Logging  

4. Application Layer  
   - Dynamic Pricing Engine  
   - Load Control Logic  
   - Real-Time Dashboard  

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Dynamic Time-of-Use Pricing
- Peak Hour Detection
- Automated Load Shedding (EV control during peak)
- Power Consumption Calculation
- Cost Estimation
- Cloud-Based Dashboard
- Energy Usage Logging

## 🚀 Deployment

The system is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and accessible remotely via web interface.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with ESP8266/ESP32 smart meters
- MQTT-based communication
- AWS IoT Core deployment
- Real-time hardware integration
- AI-based demand forecasting

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)
